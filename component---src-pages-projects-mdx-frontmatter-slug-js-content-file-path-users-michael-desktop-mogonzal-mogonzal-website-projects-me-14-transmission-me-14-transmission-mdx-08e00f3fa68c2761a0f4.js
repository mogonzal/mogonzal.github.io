We propose our designs during a scheduled preliminary design review (PDR) followed by\na detailed design during a critical design review (CDR) as well as submit a bill of materials to purchase hardware\ncomponents and CAD files and GD&T drawings for manufacturing and assembly by the Caltech MCE machine shop. Assembled\ntransmissions will be coupled to a DC motor and mechanical drivetrain testing assembly and evaluated at the end of the\nclass.

If the input shaft spins counter-clockwise, the first clutch slips and the\nsecond engages, meaning now the second gear train dictates the driving ratio.
