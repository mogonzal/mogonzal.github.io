They are more\nexpensive, but are much less likely to break and will give you much more pushing power, especially if you are using more\nmagnets. I'd also recommend not using a Roboclaw as the dedicated motor controller—it's very convenient for setting up\nthe electronics quickly, but due to it being a separate component, it caused our code's loop time to be pretty high\nbecause of read delays. In terms of general priorities, I wish we'd spent less time programming different autonomous\nroutines because our robot was already leagues ahead of the other teams in this category. In fact, I'm pretty sure we\nwere the only team to have sensing and pathfinding implemented for the competition; most other teams just randomly moved\nacross the dohyo waiting to hit something."),"\n",o.createElement("br"),"\n",o.createElement(t.p,null,"Overall, I'm incredibly happy with how we performed. Even with all of the major challenges described above, we were able\nto throw together two very solid robots that, when no untimely mechanical failures occured, were crowd favorites and\nalmost always beat out the competition.
